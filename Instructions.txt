To setup the sound follow this:

The OpenAL folder and the audio folder needs to go in the game directory


These need to be added to the correct paths

C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories: OpenAL\include

Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories: OpenAL\libs and OpenAL\libs\Win32
Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependancies: alut.lib and openal32.lib

Build Events -> Post-Build Event -> Command Line: copy "OpenAL\libs\alut.dll"

OpenAL32.DLL needs to go in windows32 folder, I've included it incase you haven't installed OpenAL



////////////////
// TO PLAY FILES

You need to get the instance of the audio manager in each file your using sound in
similar to the engine and the camera

CAudioManager* mpAudio = CTLManager::GetInstance()->GetAudio();

To load a file you need to create an ID for it in the enum type located in the audio includes header
Theres a few sample ones in there, just make sure what you add comes before AUDIO_LAST

Once you've done that you need to load a file like so:

			   ID		File name
if(!mpAudio.createSource(CLICK, "audio/cinBoom.wav"))
{
	cout << "Error: Failed to load sound CinBoom.wav\n";
}


This code needs to go in the "loadSounds" member function of CAudioManager

To play the file:
mpAudio->play(CLICK);
